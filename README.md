## Description

In this project, we were tasked to build a foundation API for a social network web application where users can share
their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list form the backend. From the backend, we will be able to receive all users, create, update and delete users, get, create, update and delete thoughts, and also add and delete reactions. Lastly, we will be able to add mutual friends to each other.


## Instructions

In this project, you will have to clone the repo to start and then install dependencies (npm i) & (npm install mongodb). To set up the MongoDb Atlas - you will need to setup dotenv.


## Usage

This could be used for the backend for a basic social media platform.

## Contributers

## Testing

To make the tests, you would have to set up the routes through Insomnia.
